### Hi there 👋

I'm a self taught programmer who loves playing video games, camping, and playing music.
I have experience in webdev (front and backend), as well as Unity, Minecraft Modding, GD Modding, and many languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python)

I have been very interested in modding games and working with those frameworks, and have made some cool projects based off of it!
